      <h1>Welcome to Slash</h1>

     Slash is a testing framework written in Python. Unlike many other testing frameworks out there, Slash focuses on building in-house testing solutions for large projects. 
   
     Slash provides several key features:
   
     * A solid execution model based on fixtures, test factories and tests. This provides you with the flexibility you need to express your testing logic.
     * A rich configuration mechanism, helping you setting up your environment parameters and their various flavours.
     * A plugin architecture, greatly simplifying adding extra functionality to your framework.

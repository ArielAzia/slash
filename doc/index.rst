What is Shakedown?
==================

Shakedown is a testing framework written in Python. Unlike many other testing frameworks out there, Shakedown focuses on building in-house testing solutions for large projects. 

Shakedown provides several key features:

1. A solid execution model based on fixtures, test factories and tests. This provides you with the flexibility you need to express your testing logic.
2. A rich configuration mechanism, helping you setting up your environment parameters and their various flavours.
3. A plugin architecture, greatly simplifying adding extra functionality to your framework.

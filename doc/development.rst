Development
===========

Shakedown tries to bring a lot of features to the first releases. For starters, the very first usable version (0.0.1) aims at providing basic running support and most of the groundwork needed for the following milestones.

Development takes place on `github <https://github.com/vmalloc/shakedown>`_. Feel free to open issues or pull requests, as a lot of the project's success depends on your feedback!

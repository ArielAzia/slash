Welcome to Slash
================

Slash is a testing framework written in Python. Unlike many other testing frameworks out there, Slash focuses on building in-house testing solutions for large projects. 
   
Slash provides several key features:
   
* A solid execution model based on fixtures, test factories and tests. This provides you with the flexibility you need to express your testing logic.
* A rich configuration mechanism, helping you setting up your environment parameters and their various flavours.
* A plugin architecture, greatly simplifying adding extra functionality to your framework.
